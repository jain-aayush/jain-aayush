# My Precious Projects

## [Pixels and Pages](https://github.com/jain-aayush/PixelsAndPages)

* Created a books and movies recommender system that is one of its kind as unlike traditional recommender systems, it recommends books based on the types of movies one likes and recommends movies based on the kind of books you've read.
* Used GloVe word embeddings to calculate the vector representation of the Movie and Book Descriptions and then calculated the Euclidean Distance to find the most similar movies or books to recommend.
* Created the dataset using Goodreads API for books and TMdB API for the movies and then served the final model on a Website using Flask.

## [EverythingGANs](https://github.com/jain-aayush/EverythingGANs)

* Implemented various Generative Adversarial Network models using Tensorflow and then served the models using Flask.
* Implemted SRGAN, CycleGAN and Pix2Pix models and trained them for Image Superresolution, Animate Me and Image Deraining tasks.
